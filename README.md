# Customer Segmentation Project

**Customer Segmentation** is the practise of dividing company's customers into groups that reflect similarities among customers in each group.

The goal of segmenting customers is to decide how to relate to customers in each segment in order to maximize of each customer to the business.
The process requires thought-out strategy, understanding how to manage and group customers and which data you will use to do this.

Customer Segmentation uses cluster analysis which implements **K-Means** Algorithm.

K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. It is a technique used to organize data into groups based on their similarity.
